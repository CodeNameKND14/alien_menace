## Automatic Table and Date Search


- Created a basic HTML web page.


Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the created web page and then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
